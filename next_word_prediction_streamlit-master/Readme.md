# Next Word Prediction with BERT and Streamlit

Welcome to our Next Word Prediction project powered by BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and Streamlit. This project demonstrates how to build an interactive application that predicts the next word in a sentence using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for our Next Word Prediction application. The model is based on BERT, a pre-trained transformer model developed by Google AI for natural language understanding tasks. We use PyTorch for model deployment and Streamlit for creating a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **BERT Model:** Utilizes BERT for masked language modeling to predict the next word in a sentence.
- **Streamlit Interface:** Provides an intuitive web application for users to interact with the prediction model.
- **Customizable Output:** Allows users to specify the number of word suggestions and see real-time predictions as they type.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Pip package manager

streamlit run app.py
